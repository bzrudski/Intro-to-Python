    "Dear `Reader | Workshop Attendee`,  \n",
    "Welcome! In this interactive Jupyter Notebook, I will introduce you to the [Python](https://www.python.org) programming language. In this workshop, we'll journey from the beginnings of storing data in variables and doing simple calculations to writing powerful functions to perform repeatable operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the **student version**, which contains several blanks where I will write code during the workshop and where you can fill out exercises. There is a [**solution version**](../solutions/IntroToPythonBZR.ipynb) in the `solutions` folder. I recommend trying the exercises yourself before looking at the solutions, There is often more than one way to answer a programming question, so you should focus more on understanding the code that you are writing, instead of just copying my answers. You may come up with an answer better than the one I've provided!\n",

We (and the computer) know this because the line starts with the symbol `#`. Python ignores that symbol and everything that comes after it, letting you write notes about what your code is doing. It's very important to put comments in your code, especially if you're going to need to come back to it after a few weeks or if you're going to share it with other people.\n",

We'll discuss functions in more detail later, but the idea is that functions take inputs, known as **arguments**, do operations on them and optionally return some sort of modified result. Here, the `print` function takes in the **string** of text \"Hello, World!\", writes it onto the screen and doesn't return any new data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Python is **object-oriented**... What does that mean?\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's take a step back...\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an Object?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **object** is a combination of **variables** (data) and of **functions** (behaviours) that can modify the data. The data contained in an object are known as **attributes** and the functions associated with the object are known as **methods**.\n",
    "\n",
    "All objects have a **type**, which tells you what kind of object they are. All objects of the same type have the **same** attributes (although not necessarily the same *value*) and the same available methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we're talking about cars. All cars have *attributes*, like colour, year and model. They also have *methods*, like turning on, turning off, switching gear, and activating the headlights. Your car may be red while mine may be blue, and they may be from different manufacturers and have different ages, but they're still both cars. They both *have* these attributes and they both can do the same things (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a biological example, let's say we're looking at mice for an experiment. All mice have certain basic biological parameters, such as age and sex. They may also have attributes related to your experiment, such as a specific genotype or phenotype. All these define the **attributes** of each mouse. There are also certain experimental manipulations that can be performed on the mice, such as feeding, or exercising (I don't work with mice, but bear with me...). These define the mouse **methods**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, **everything is an object**. This doesn't really do much for the primitive types that we talked about above. But, it gets more important when we start discussing more complicated types of data, like **strings** and **collections**."

    "Yay! We've made it through our second content module! Here, we've explored the basics of strings and collection types. Here are the main points that we saw:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An **object** groups together variables, known as **attributes** and functions, known as **methods**.\n",
    "* A **string** represents *text* in Python. We can use **slicing** to access its elements. We can also perform operations, like **concatenation and string formatting**, and use **methods** to get extra info about a string or create modified versions of it.\n",
    "* A **tuple** represents a *small number of objects grouped together*. To access elements, we can either use slicing, or we can **unpack** its contents into the corresponding number of variables. Tuples can't be modified.\n",
    "* A **list** represents a *variable-length collection* of objects. We can add or remove objects from the list using **list methods**, such as `append`, `insert` and `pop`. We can also iterate over all elements of a list using a `for` loop.\n",
    "* A **dictionary** represents *key-value storage*. Instead of having a numeric index, we access **values** using a **key**. We can add or remove elements using keys and we can modify the dictionary using **dictionary methods**, such as `pop` and `update`. We can also use the `keys`, `values` and `items` methods to get different pieces of information.\n",
    "* All of these are **objects**, which means that they store information and have functions, or **methods** associated with them.\n",
    "* We can iterate over all these types of objects to process individual elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about any of these objects, check out the official Python documentation. There's a lot of detail about each type:\n",
    "* Strings: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str\n",
    "* Tuples: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple\n",
    "* Lists: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list\n",
    "* Dictionaries: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there's another collection type that I didn't discuss, called a *set*. If you want to learn about it, check out this page: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset."

    "### A Bit of Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, functions are defined using the `def` keyword. The syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def function_name(argument1, argument2, argument3, ..., argumentN):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    documentation here\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    your_code_here...\n",
    "\n",
    "    return some_value\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here are the important elements to notice when **defining** a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The function definition begins with the `def` keyword. This is similar to the `function` keyword in Javascript, or the `func` keyword in Swift.\n",
    "* The **function name** follows the same rules as variable names. There are different naming conventions for names that consist of multiple words (`snake_case` vs `camelCase`). By common convention, the function name starts with a **lowercase** letter.\n",
    "* After the function name, you can include a list of parameters in parentheses. **If your function takes no arguments, you must still put the brackets.** Each argument in the list must have a valid variable name. We'll discuss these in more detail later.\n",
    "* After closing the argument list bracket, we put a **colon** (`:`).\n",
    "* After the first line, we must **indent**. This tells Python where the function body begins and ends.\n",
    "* We can start the body with a **docstring**, which describes the function. We'll discuss these more later.\n",
    "* Then, you write your code as normal. In this function body, treat the arguments **like normal variables**.\n",
    "* To **output** a result that can be used later, use the keyword `return`, followed by the result. We'll discuss this more later.\n",
    "* After finishing to define the function, simply stop indenting. There's no need to close any brackets or type `end`."

    "\n",
    "This section is based on the corresponding sections in two of my previous workshops (see [Intro to Python - Summer 2024](https://github.com/bzrudski/micm_intro_to_python_summer_2024) and [Intermediate Python - Summer 2024](https://github.com/bzrudski/micm_intermediate_python_summer_2024)).\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing code, there are a bunch of resources that can help you!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Code Editor\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! That's write! The software you're using to write code can give you lots of help. It can suggest completions and tell when there are errors and even help you reformat your files and restructure your code. So, please, please, please, **DO NOT** write your code in a simple text editor that has not additional features. And ***PLEASE*** don't use a word processing software. Use software that is made for coding!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "I mentioned this one earlier. Documentation isn't just something that you should do. Big established projects have big documentation. Take a look at their guides for getting started. For example, [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) has a [10 minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html) tutorial. Other packages, like [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) have very thorough guides and/or examples. Use these resources! If you want to learn how to use a function, **look it up** and read the paragraph about it. It will tell you how to use the arguments, any quirks to expect, and in some cases it will give you references about the papers behind the function. This is especially true in image processing and other fields that rely heavily on algorithms. So, the documentation will tell you not only how to use the code, but also **where it comes from**. And make sure to check out the Official Python docs at https://docs.python.org/3/.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Books\n",
    "\n",
    "Books, books, books! There are tons! And tons of books out there! For example, there are a couple of general books that are free online:\n",
    "* *Think Python 2e* by Allen B. Downey (FREE book): https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/\n",
    "* *Data Structures and Information Retrieval in Python* also by Allen B. Downey (FREE book): https://greenteapress.com/wp/data-structures-and-information-retrieval-in-python/\n",
    "* *Introduction to Python Programming* by Udayan Das et al., published by OpenStax: https://openstax.org/details/books/introduction-python-programming\n",
    "* *The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python* by Kenneth Reitz and Tanya Schlusser: https://docs.python-guide.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also books online about more specialised topics, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Package development: *Python Packages* by Tomas Beuzen and Tiffany Timbers -- https://py-pkgs.org/\n",
    "* Data science:\n",
    "    * *Python for Data Analysis, 3E* by Wes McKinney -- https://wesmckinney.com/book/\n",
    "    * *Python Data Science Handbook* by Jake VanderPlas -- https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/\n",
    "\n",
    "Another book that covers software development for research more generally, including more emphasis on the tools used is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Research Software Engineering with Python* by Damien Irving, et al.: https://third-bit.com/py-rse/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the databases at the McGill Library, we also have access to lots of books **for free**. Check out the library's online catalogue to see more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "Tutorials are also great! And very much abundant! From more formal ones on sites like [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) to less formal ones on [DEV](https://dev.to/), you can get lots of insight from these. There are also lots posted on Medium that you can check out. In addition to text-based tutorials, there are also videos on YouTube. And don't forget the official tutorials in the documentation! Tutorials are a very valuable resource that can help you see how to put pieces of code together in real-world examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stack Overflow (and Pitfalls)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a Python question, chances are that someone, somewhere has asked it on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Stack Overflow is a **great** resource for finding answers to real questions about programming. **But** make sure that you're using it properly. Try the other resources before going to Stack Overflow. The answer may turn out to be on the documentation page for the function you're looking for. If there's a link to the docs in a Stack Overflow answer, **use it**. Check out in more detail. Make sure that you understand the code that you're about to add to your project and don't just copy-paste it. Coding is a thinking game. Make sure that you have thought about all the code that you're putting in and that you understand why it's there. And use your judgement and intuition when borrowing that code. If it looks sketchy, it could very well be sketchy and there may be a better way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ChatGPT (and Pitfalls)\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything I said above about Stack Overflow. And more. Answers on Stack Overflow are written by humans who have written the code, tested it, and run the results. Be careful when using ChatGPT for code (if you're allowed to at all). Make extra sure that it makes sense, and test it. Don't just trust it because AI wrote it for you. You need to make extra sure that it actually makes sense and runs properly, because you don't have that same guarantee that a human has used this exact code in their own experience. Use your coding judgement and intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, ALWAYS remember to **read the documentation**. Often, if you're stuck, the answer is **right there**. If it's not, then it's probably on Stack Overflow. It's often a good idea to check the documentation **first** to see if there's an official explanation or an official example. And don't just copy a Stack Overflow answer or sample code. Think about what the code is doing. Does it make sense? Is there a better way? Try to look line by line to understand what is going on (play around in the IPython interpreter or in a Jupyter notebook!).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other Cool Programming Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I talked a bit about functions and classes, but there's much more that you can look into to help build your programming skills and write code that others will want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen how to install and use packages. But, you can also **write your own packages**. There are many great resources online about writing packages. The one that I most recommend is [this free online book](https://py-pkgs.org/): *Python Packages* by Tomas Beuszen and Tiffany Timbers. It's an easy read and helps you learn not only how to organise your code, but how to publish it, too. The authors also walk through how to render your own nice-looking documentation and host that online.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing code with loops and control flow is fun, but it's even better when we can combine everything into functions and classes and work in an **object-oriented** manner. This paradigm helps you organise your code differently, constructing building blocks that can work together to build elaborate programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Developing Graphical User Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks and command line scripts are powerful, but they aren't accessible for people who don't know how to code. Solution: build a graphical user interface! Using PyQt, the process is quite straightforward. Check out [this online tutorial series](https://www.pythonguis.com/) by Martin Fitzpatrick to learn about developing GUIs in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hosting Projects on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "What fun is a project if other people can't use it? By hosting your project on GitHub, you let others easily contribute to your project and build on it. Learning Git and GitHub are essential! And so are a few other skills along the way, like writing documents in Markdown. MiCM often has Git and GitHub workshops, so check out their workshop schedule!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The End\n",
    "\n",
    "We've reached the end of our workshop! For those of you who have previous programming experience, congratulations on adding another language to your repertoire. For those of you who are new, welcome to the world of programming! Just remember, programming is like art: you start with an empty text file and soon enough, you have hundreds (or thousands) of lines of code!\n",
