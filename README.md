## Overview

In this 4-hour workshop, participants will be introduced to the basics
of programming in Python. Students will journey from the beginnings of
creating variables and performing simple mathematical operations to
writing code that can perform fundamental tasks and wrapping this code
into functions. Participants will learn how to write the important
building blocks that make up complex programs.

## Learning Objectives

1.  Store data in variables and collections.
2.  Perform basic operations on these data.
3.  Use control flow and loops to write powerful code.
4.  Define functions to create repeatable units of behaviour.

## Prerequisites

* Basic computer science knowledge of data types and control
  structures.
* No prior programming experience is required, but knowing another
  language may help.
* To be able to participate in the exercises, participants must
  either:
    * Have a local installation of Python and Jupyter notebooks.
      Microsoft Visual Studio Code with the Python extension installed
      can also be used to run the Notebook.
    * Have a Google Account (to run in-browser as a Colab notebook)

## Setup Information

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for full setup information. After setting up Python, you can download the material as a ZIP file using the green button higher up on this page, or by cloning this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/bzrudski/Intro-to-Python.git
```

## Outline
