Dear reader,  
This repository contains the code, outline and slides for the **QLS-MiCM Introduction 
to Python** workshop at McGill in Fall 2024.

This workshop is the first part of a two-part series. The second part, on **Intermediate Python** can be found [here](https://github.com/bzrudski/micm_intermediate_python_fall_2024).

This workshop is based on my previous iterations of the workshop, which can be found at the following repositories:
* [Summer 2024](https://github.com/bzrudski/micm_intro_to_python_summer_2024)
* [Winter 2024](https://github.com/bzrudski/micm_intro_to_python_winter_2024)
* [Summer 2023](https://github.com/bzrudski/micm_intro_to_python_summer_2023)
* [Fall 2022](https://github.com/bzrudski/micm_intro_to_python_fall_2022)

This workshop covers a basic introduction to the Python programming language.
