## Overview

In this 4-hour workshop, participants will be introduced to the basics
of programming in Python. Students will journey from the beginnings of
creating variables and performing simple mathematical operations to
writing code that can perform fundamental tasks and wrapping this code
into functions. Participants will learn how to write the important
building blocks that make up complex programs.

## Learning Objectives

1.  Store data in variables and collections.
2.  Perform basic operations on these data.
3.  Use control flow and loops to write powerful code.
4.  Define functions to create repeatable units of behaviour.

## Prerequisites

* Basic computer science knowledge of data types and control
  structures.
* No prior programming experience is required, but knowing another
  language may help.
* To be able to participate in the exercises, participants must
  either:
    * Have a local installation of Python and Jupyter notebooks.
      Microsoft Visual Studio Code with the Python extension installed
      can also be used to run the Notebook.
    * Have a Google Account (to run in-browser as a Colab notebook)

## Setup Information

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for full setup information. After setting up Python, you can download the material as a ZIP file using the green button higher up on this page, or by cloning this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/bzrudski/Intro-to-Python.git
```

### Requirements

To take full advantage of this interactive workshop, you must have access to a Python environment and Jupyter Lab.

#### Local

The required steps depend on how you installed Python:

* **(Recommended)** If you installed **minconda**, you can easily install Jupyter Lab by running the following on the command line:
```
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```
* If you installed Python from the official website, you can easily install Jupyter using `pip` by running the following on the command line:
```
pip install jupyterlab
```
* If you installed **Anaconda**, you already have Jupyter Lab installed.

For more details on installing Jupyter Lab, see https://jupyter.org/install.


Once you have Jupyter installed, open the `Intro-to-Python` folder on your computer and launch Jupyter Lab by typing:

```
jupyter lab
```

Then you can open the Jupyter notebook files.

#### Cloud

If you don't want to install anything locally, you can open the workshop materials using Google Colab:

* Solution version (filled out): https://colab.research.google.com/github/bzrudski/Intro-to-Python/blob/main/Exercises/solutions/IntroToPythonBZR.ipynb

## Outline

*For a more detailed outline, see [Outline/Intro-to-Python-Outline.md](Outline/Intro-to-Python-Outline.md).*

1.  **Module 1 -- Python Basics**
2.  **Module 2 -- Strings and Collections: An Object Primer**
3.  **Module 3 -- Introduction to Functions**
4.  **Module 4 -- Where to go from here**
