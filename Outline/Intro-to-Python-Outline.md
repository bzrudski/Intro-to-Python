# Intro to Python (Part 1)

**Approximate duration:** 4 hours

## Prerequisites

-   Basic computer science knowledge of data types and control
    structures.
-   No prior programming experience is required, but knowing another
    language may help.
-   To be able to participate in the exercises, participants must
    either:
    -   Have a local installation of Python and Jupyter notebooks.
        Microsoft Visual Studio Code with the Python extension installed
        can also be used to run the Notebook.
    -   Have a Google Account (to run in-browser as a Colab notebook)

## Summary

In this 4-hour workshop, participants will be introduced to the basics
of programming in Python. Students will journey from the beginnings of
creating variables and performing simple mathematical operations to
writing code that can perform fundamental tasks and wrapping this code
into functions. Participants will learn how to write the important
building blocks that make up complex programs.

## Learning Objectives

1.  Store data in variables and collections.
2.  Perform basic operations on these data.
3.  Use control flow and loops to write powerful code.
4.  Define functions to create repeatable units of behaviour.
